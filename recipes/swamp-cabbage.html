    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces thick-cut bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>6 ounces hickory-smoked sausage, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick half moons</li>
        <li>1 (2 pound) green cabbage, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can hearts of palm, drained and roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
            Add bacon and cook, stirring occasionally,
            until most of bacon starts to turn brown, about 8 minutes;
            add sausage and continue cooking, stirring often,
            until bacon and sausage are crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic; cook, stirring often,
            until tender, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add cabbage, salt, onion powder, and black pepper;
            cook, stirring often, until cabbage starts to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Add diced tomatoes, hearts of palm, and broth; stir until evenly combined.
        </li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat; cover and cook,
            stirring every few minutes, until cabbage is tender
            and most of the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
